Working title: **Galactic Siege**
## Game Concept
A modern Space Invaders-inspired game with roguelite mechanics. Players face waves of enemies, level up, and choose from randomized power-ups and modules to shape their playstyle. The game includes bosses with unique mechanics, encouraging replayability.

The target audience are retro game enthusiasts, people who enjoy roguelite elements and replayability with some score chasing mixed in.

## Visual Style
Retro-futuristic with neon colors, inspired by Tron. The assets and GUI will be sleek to reflect the space theme of the game.

## End Goal
Achieve the highest score. After each session, players can see how their score was achieved.

## Milestones
## 1. Core Mechanics
- Movement: The ship moves with thrust towards the mouse or analog stick, with momentum carried across screen edges.
- Health System: The player has health, shields (regen or delayed), and armor (damage absorption). Health is lost if shields deplete, and the player dies when it hits 0.
- Weapon and shooting: A weapon to damage enemies.
- Menu Navigation: Playing, pausing and quitting.

### 2. Closing the Gameplay Loop
- Score and Waves: Score increases with time since it's a roguelike, and more enemies spawn once the rest are dead.
- Game Over Screen and Leaderboard: A place to view the run and either play again or quit.
- Enemy AI and shooting: So the enemies can shoot back at the player.

## 3. Extras (nice to have)
- XP: Killing enemies grants more score than just elapsed time.
- Animations: Explosions and UI animations.
- Assets: Suitable assets for a space game.
- Weapons: Additional weapon types.
- Enemies: Additional enemy types.
