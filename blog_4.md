Some more updates:
- Aesthetic changes to assets
    Initially, we used basic shapes - a triangle for the player, squares for asteroids + debris, and circles for ammunition. That by itself isn't polished, so we made some simple sprites in Clip Studio Paint that have a more appropriate space theme. The background was also set to an image of space. Setting the background was a bit more difficult considering the camera is instantiated at runtime, so we had to first instantiate the camera, instantiate the background, and then grab the instance of the camera object and attach the background to it. Doing this in the wrong order makes it not spawn, and setting it to the wrong render mode (aka not Screen Space - Camera) makes it spawn over the other assets.
- Enemy spawn and pathing
- Randomly spawning asteroids that float across the screen, which get broken up into 3 pieces of debris when shot or colliding with other game objects
    We initially wanted to include assets from the asset store, but considering the style of the game and its 2D elements, nothing seemed to really fit, so we made our own assets. Asteroids spawn at random along the borders of the screen as varying velocities and rotations. They don't interact with the player yet, but they despawn if they drift off-screen and break up into 3 pieces with varying velocities when hit with ammunition, and emit a crumbling sound effect when destroyed. We initially tried making the original asteroid the sound source, but upon destroying the game object in order to instantiate the debris, we discovered that the sound doesn't play fully since the game object is destroyed, so instead, we made the sound quieter and attached the sound source to the debris.
