Some more updates:
- Aesthetic changes to assets
    - Initially, we used basic shapes - a triangle for the player, squares for asteroids + debris, and circles for ammunition. That by itself isn't polished, so we made some simple sprites in Clip Studio Paint that have an appropriate space theme. Setting the background was a bit more difficult since the camera is instantiated at runtime, so we had to first create the camera, create the background, and then grab the instance of the camera and attach the background to it. Doing this in the wrong order makes it not spawn, and setting it to the wrong render mode (aka not Screen Space - Camera) makes it spawn over other assets.
- Enemy spawn and pathing
    - Enemy AI was a bit of a kerfuffle, mostly getting it to collide with the player character. Naturally, the general idea is to have a generic enemy base class taht all the enemies would inherit from in order to have a more scalable solution. We ended up implementing enemies that shoot first, since the logic shooting was already implemented and melee enemies would have to rely on a bunch of complicated-sounding trigonometry functions in order to calculate velocity-based damage. Currently, the enemies are capalbe of following the player character in a swarm-like pattern, shooting at them. This will likely need to be tweaked for gameplay purposes as we implement features like health and shields, since it already seems like it could be a bit overwhelming.
- Randomly spawning asteroids
    - These get broken up into 3 pieces of debris when shot or colliding with other game objects. Asteroids spawn at random along the borders of the screen as varying velocities and rotations. They don't interact with the player yet, but they despawn if they drift off-screen and break up into 3 pieces with varying velocities when hit with ammunition, and emit a crumbling sound when destroyed. We initially tried making the original asteroid the sound source, but upon destroying the game object in order to instantiate the debris, we discovered that the sound doesn't play fully since the game object is destroyed, so instead, we made the sound quieter and attached the sound source to the debris.
- XP and waves
    - Waves are just checks after all present enemies are killed, and spawns a few extra. XP is added to the score based on a value assigned to the enemies. The wave UI has an animation attached to fade in and out for a smoother effect.
- Factory pattern refactoring
    - Now that we know about SOLID design patterns, we wanted to try and have looser coupling between components. Instead of having a GameManager that has many different things under its control, we implemented the factory pattern to spawn the prefabs we need at the start of the game and have the initialization logic contained in those classes.
